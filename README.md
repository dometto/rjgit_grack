Alternative Adapter for [grack](http://github.com/grackorg/grack); uses the [RJGit](http://github.com/repotag/rjgit) gem for a pure jruby interface to git repos. Together with Grack, this yields a pure jruby implementation of git's smart-http protocol.

Installation
===========

 `gem install rjgit_grack`

Usage
===========

1. Get [grack](https://github.com/grackorg/grack).
2. add `grack` and `rjgit_grack` to your `Gemfile`
3. You can tell Grack to use the `RJGitAdapter` by editing its configuration, for example:

```ruby
require 'grack/app'
require 'grack/rjgit_adapter'

config = {
  :root => '/tmp/',
  :allow_push => true,
  :allow_pull => true,
  :git_adapter_factory => ->{ Grack::RJGitAdapter.new }
}

run Grack::App.new(config)
```

Hooks
===========

This adapter allows you to specify hooks to be called when receive operations (i.e. `git push` to the server) or upload operations (e.g. pulls, clones) are initiated. You can easily do this by passing an options hash to the `Grack::RJGitAdapter.new` call in the configuration, like so:

```ruby
  :git_adapter_factory => ->{ Grack::RJGitAdapter.new({
    :preReceive => Proc.new do |received_refs|
      # This code is executed in the hook
      puts received_refs
    end
    }
  )}
```

You can specify the following hooks:
  * `:preReceive` executed immediately before a receive-operation is performed. Yields an `Array` with `Hash` objects containing info about each ref that is about to be pushed, of the following form:
    ```
      {:ref_name => 'refs/heads/masters', :old_id => 'somesha1', :new_id => 'someothersha1', :type => "FAST_FORWARD"}
    ```
  * `:postReceive` executed after a receive-operation is completed. Yields an `Array` with `Hash` objects for each ref that was pushed, of the same form as above, plus a `:result` field. The result will be a `String`, and can have one of the values [defined by JGit](http://download.eclipse.org/jgit/site/4.3.0.201604071810-r/apidocs/index.html).
  * `:preUpload` executed immediately before an upload-operation is performed, i.e. before data is sent to the client. Yields an `Array` of `String` object-id's (SHA1-hashes) already in common between client and server.
  * `:postUpload` executed after an upload-operation to a client is complete. Returns an `org.eclipse.jgit.storage.pack.PackStatistics` object (see [here](http://download.eclipse.org/jgit/site/4.3.0.201604071810-r/apidocs/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackStatistics.html)).

Note that JGit blocks all read and write operations on the repository until a hook is complete, so the hooks should only contain code that runs quickly (e.g. running workers or threads to perform the heavy work).
